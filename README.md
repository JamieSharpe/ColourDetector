ColourDetector
==============

This is a simple colour detector application that gets the current colour at the cursors position.

It displays the colour in RGB [0-255], RGB Hexidecimal, saturation, hue, brightness, and if it's a known colour.

The colour wheel icon is from [famfamfam](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/ "Silk Icons").
